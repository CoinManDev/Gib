# Gib
This is a git clone. Yes. It is absoloutely horrifingly bad. This is why it is also know as git but worse. With some crappy ugly code. Proud of it.

# Instructions

- First run build.exe. That will add a gib folder to your root directory
- Then choose some file to keep track of
- Now open up your terminal and navigate to the downloaded git folder
- Once you are there write this: ".\gib.exe new (choose a name) (the path of the file you want to keep track of)". 
replace the pharantheases.
- That will create a new box. A box is just a place to keep the things for your file.
- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE BOX
